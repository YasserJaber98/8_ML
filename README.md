Customer Churn Prediction System
A comprehensive machine learning system for predicting customer churn in a music streaming service, featuring automated retraining, drift detection, and real-time monitoring.

Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end solution for customer churn prediction using event log data from a music streaming platform. The system addresses key challenges including:

Class imbalance (23.1% churn rate)
Missing user IDs recovery
Data leakage prevention
Real-time monitoring and drift detection

Key Results
Model Performance: F1 Score of 82.4% on minority class (churned users)
Data Recovery: Successfully recovered 98% of missing user IDs using custom algorithm
Stability: Model shows excellent stability across different random seeds (std: 0.0058)

Technical Challenges & Solutions
1. Missing User IDs
Challenge: 8,346 records without user IDs
Solution: Developed custom imputation algorithm using:

Session ID and item sequence patterns
Temporal proximity
Sequence validation logic

2. Session ID Reuse
Challenge: Session IDs shared across multiple users
Solution: Combined sessionId + itemInSession for accurate user tracking
3. Churn Definition
Challenge: Defining accurate churn criteria
Solution: Used explicit churn signal (Cancellation Confirmation page visit)
üîÑ Retraining Strategy
The system supports automated retraining based on:

Time-based: Every 30 days
Performance-based: When F1 score drops below 0.75
Drift-based: When significant feature drift is detected

Monitoring & Alerting

Real-time performance metrics
Feature drift scores with threshold alerts
Concept drift detection through windowed performance analysis
Business KPI tracking

‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

Data Storage: Currently using local file system (production should use cloud storage)
Model Storage: Models stored locally (production should use model registry)
Scheduling: Retraining scheduler written but not active (needs production scheduler like Airflow)
Docker: Configuration complete but may need environment-specific adjustments
Database: Using mock data (production needs real database connection)

Future Improvements

Technical Enhancements:

Migrate to cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure/GCP)
Implement Kubernetes for container orchestration
Add CI/CD pipeline
Implement A/B testing framework

Model Improvements:

Explore deep learning for sequence modeling
Implement SMOTE for better class balance
Add ensemble methods
Include external features (seasonality, holidays)


Note: This is a demonstration project. Some components (Docker, scheduling, cloud storage) are implemented but not fully operational in the current development environment.
